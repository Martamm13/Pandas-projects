# Pandas Projects Collection
This repository showcases my work with Pandas for data analysis and visualization. Each project highlights how I've used Pandas to clean, process, and analyze real-world datasets to uncover insights and trends

## Projects

- [Movie-Genres-Data-Analysis-Project](Movie-Genres-Data-Analysis-Project)- a project where I split and processed movie genre data to explore trends in genres over time. I used Pandas to clean the dataset, calculate average profits, and visualize the results using heatmaps and bar charts.

- [Food-Marketing-Data-Analysis](Food-Marketing-Data-Analysis)
